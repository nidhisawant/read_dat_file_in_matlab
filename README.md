Repo to read '.dat' file in matlab using python

I have been facing issue with using wfdb toolbox in matlab. Specifically not able to read '.dat' file and '.atr' file. But there is no issue in python to use wfdb package.

The code is developed to read the 'Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Events Detection from Dynamic ECG Recordings: The 4th China Physiological Signal Challenge 2021' dataset link: https://physionet.org/content/cpsc2021/1.0.0/.
